# Basic Modeling Concepts

Chapters \@ref(physics-and-perception-of-sound) and \@ref(harmonic-and-inharmonic-sounds) focused on the "understand the problem" stage of problem solving, introducing the basic concepts and terminology of sounds we want to model.
The present chapter pivots to the "make a plan" stage of problem solving by introducing the model elements and how they interact.
Since we are building models using modular synthesis, the model elements are the modules, and their interactions are driven by how they are connected together in a patch.
Figure \@ref(fig:serge-modular-2) shows an example patch on a real modular synthesizer from Chapter \@ref(introduction).

(ref:serge-modular-2) A Serge modular system based on a 1970s design. Each module is labeled at the top edge, e.g. `Wave Multiplier`, and extends down to the bottom edge in a column. Note that although the modules have the same height, they have different widths.

It's impractical to assume that you, the reader, will have access to the exact same physical modules we will discuss.
For that reason, we will use open source modular software called Patchcab [@Spectrome2021] that has been integrated into the book.
Patchcab is relatively simple and runs in the browser, which for our needs makes it preferable to the popular open source modular software, VCVRack [@VCVRack2022], which is desktop based.[^VCVRack is otherwise recommended. Both @Bjoern2018 and @Dusha2020 have distributed VCVRack patch files with their books.]
