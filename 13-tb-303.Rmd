# TB-303

This chapter examines a new sound design problem using the problem solving approach introduced in Chapter \@ref(designing-a-kick-drum).
The problem is to create a lead by recreating some of the fundamental characteristics of the Roland TB-303, which is an iconic instrument in acid house and subsequent genres of electronic music.

## History

The [TB-303](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TB-303) (303; see Figure \@ref(fig:303)),  was released in 1981 and withdrawn in 1984 as a commercial failure.
The original purpose of the 303 was to replace a bass guitar in much the same way as a drum machine like the [TR-808](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roland_TR-808) was meant to replace drums.
With its 92-page instruction manual, the 303 was widely considered as difficult to use, which together with a $1300 price tag^[In 2022 dollars.], likely led to its demise.

```


The 303's failure in the marketplace, however, meant that it was cheaply available in the secondhand market.
Dance music artists, most notably in Chicago, began incorporating the 303 into their performances, and the 303 became a signature sound of [acid house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_house).
While the 303 was designed for bass guitar sounds, which are a common element of [disco](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco) dance music, the 303 could also easily (and perhaps more easily) produce sounds nothing like a bass guitar or any other instrument from that time (squelch, chirp, and scream are common descriptors).

The 303's sequencer was extremely limited.
The 303 stored pitch and time information separately, and each of these were entered using separate modes.
As a result, it was not possible to change the complete sequence in real time, i.e. during performance. 
However, it was very easy to change the timbre of an existing sequence using various parameter knobs (mostly across the top in Figure \@ref(fig:303)). 
The combined difficulty of imputing note sequences and the ease of using parameter knobs to sculpt timbres led early acid house pioneers to focus on the later.^[https://www.dwrl.utexas.edu/2016/11/22/rhetorical-synthesis-the-story-of-the-roland-tb-303/]
Thus repeating sequences with shifting timbres became a defining feature of acid house, as shown the early example in Figure \@ref(fig:acid-tracks).

(ref:acid-tracks) [*Acid Tracks*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_Tracks) by [Phuture](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phuture). *Acid Tracks* helped define the sound of acid house.
