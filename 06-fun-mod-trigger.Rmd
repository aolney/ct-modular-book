# Controllers 

Controllers initiate musical events, and in some cases, also define when musical events end.
In chapter \@ref(basic-modeling-concepts) we only looked at the keyboard controller, which is perhaps the most intuitive because it mirrors a traditional instrument.
Not all controllers are as obvious or as intuitive, however.
In this chapter, we will focus on clocks and sequencers, which are canonical examples of modular controllers.

## Clocks

Clocks in modular synthesis typically perform two functions.
The first function is synchronization.
Just like group of musicians may use a common reference to stay on the beat, e.g. drums, different modules can use a common clock to stay in time with each other.
A modular clock is similar in several respects to a metronome, which is a musical aid rather than a musical instrument for keeping time.
Metronomes like the one shown in Figure \@ref(fig:metronome) create a regular click or pulse that is adjustable to a given beats per minute (BPM).
For reference, most current music ranges from 80-160 BPM.^[https://blog.musiio.com/2021/08/19/which-musical-tempos-are-people-streaming-the-most/]
Likewise, a modular clock creates a trigger pulse (and occasionally, a gate) at a given BPM and makes this signal available on an output jack.

(ref:metronome) A metronome produces a periodic sound to help musicians keep rhythm. The mechanism is an inverted pendulum with a weight on the end; moving the weight up/down changes the speed of the metronome accordingly.

```

Many clocks also support ways or marking time off the main clock.
Most often these are clock divisions.
A clock division divides the clock frequency by an integer to get a new, lower frequency.
For example, if our clock is 120 BPM, then it is producing triggers at 2 Hz.
A clock division of 2 would therefore produce triggers at 1 Hz, or 60 BPM.
Clock divisions of 2, 4, and 16 are relatively common.
Each of these specialized signals requires its own jack, so typically only a few such divisions are available on a clock module.

Clock divisions can be used to implement [time signatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time_signature) that track how many beats occur in a measure (also known as a bar).
A common time signature in popular music is ${}^{4}_{4}$, which indicates there are four quarter notes per measure, in contrast to ${}^{3}_{4}$, which indicates there are three quarter notes per measure.
As long as each pulse implements a quarter note, an end of measure signal can be generated by using a clock division matching the top of the time signature.
Because a clock pulse represents the lowest resolution control signal and thus the shortest note, the using more pulses per quarter note allows more resolution and shorter notes.^[Not all modules receiving clock will interpret a pulse as a quarter note. Some have higher resolutions and so require multiple pulses to advance. Twenty-four [pulses per quarter note](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulses_per_quarter_note) is one such standard.]

The second function of a modular clock is [transport](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_(recording)) control, which is recording terminology for controls like play, pause, stop, rewind, etc.
Since clocks are not involved in recording per se, they typically have start, stop, and reset controls.
A reset signal is analogous to a rewind in the sense that all receiving modules will start at their initial states rather than where they left off.
Resets are a useful tool in both composition and recording.
Each of the transport controls is likely to have its own button for manual control, plus an output jack to send the control signal to downstream modules.

As with all things modular, its important to realize that while there are specialized clock modules, anything that produces a trigger/gate pulse can be used as a clock

<!-- An example controller is a module that waits for key presses and, on receiving them, sends a signal to initiate a musical event. -->
<!-- Another example is a sequencer, which you can think of as way of recording key presses and then playing them back to initiate musical events. -->

<!-- Chapters \@ref(physics-and-perception-of-sound) and \@ref(harmonic-and-inharmonic-sounds) focused on the "understand the problem" stage of problem solving, and they introduced both the basic concepts and terminology of modeling sound. -->
<!-- The present chapter pivots to the make/implement a plan stages of problem solving by introducing the model elements and how they interact. -->
<!-- Since we are building models for modular synthesis, the model elements are the modules, and their interactions are driven by how they are connected together in a patch. -->
<!-- Figure \@ref(fig:serge-modular-2) shows an example patch on a real modular synthesizer from Chapter \@ref(introduction). -->
