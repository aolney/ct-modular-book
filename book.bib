Learn about their systems, philosophies, patching secrets, performance tips, and passion for modular synthesis.0Besides a comprehensive introduction to synthesis and its history, the book covers systematic sections on concepts, purpose and creative possibilities of specific modules. Colorful diagrams, presentations of both popular and rare modules, semi-modular and software, as well as techniques for patching and how to get started, are provided.00Foreword by Suzanne Ciani.},

  abstract  = {Computational thinking (CT) is a popular phrase that refers to a collection of computational
ideas and habits of mind that people in computing disciplines acquire through their
work in designing programs, software, simulations, and computations performed by machinery.
Recently a computational thinking for K-12 movement has spawned initiatives across
the education sector, and educational reforms are under way in many countries. However,
modern CT initiatives should be well aware of the broad and deep history of computational
thinking, or risk repeating already refuted claims, past mistakes, and already solved
problems, or losing some of the richest and most ambitious ideas in CT. This paper
presents an overview of three important historical currents from which CT has developed:
evolution of computing's disciplinary ways of thinking and practicing, educational
research and efforts in computing, and emergence of computational science and digitalization
of society. The paper examines a number of threats to CT initiatives: lack of ambition,
dogmatism, knowing versus doing, exaggerated claims, narrow views of computing, overemphasis
on formulation, and lost sight of computational models.},
