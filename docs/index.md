# Welcome {-}

This is the official website for "Computational Thinking through Modular Sound Synthesis". This book will teach you computational thinking through modular sound synthesis (hereafter *modular*). You'll learn how to trigger sounds, create sounds, and modify sounds to solve specific sound design problems and create compositions. Along the way, you'll learn computational thinking practices that transcend modular and can be applied to a variety of problem-solving domains, but which are particularly relevant to information processing domains like computing. 

If you're wondering whether this is a book about computational thinking, or a book about modular, the answer is both: on the surface, most content is about modular, but computational thinking is a style of thinking reflected in the presentation of the material and gives it additional coherence. As you work through the book, you'll become more proficient in computational thinking practices like decomposition, algorithmic design, evaluation of solutions, pattern recognition, and abstraction.

This book is *interactive*, which is why it is an e-book rather than a paper book.^[I've also created [PDF](https://olney.ai/ct-modular-book/ct-modular-book.pdf) and [EPUB](https://olney.ai/ct-modular-book/ct-modular-book.epub) versions; these are best used when you don't have internet because they are **not** interactive.] Throughout you will encounter examples, simulations, and exercises that run in your browser to demonstrate and reinforce key concepts. Don't skip the interactive activities!
