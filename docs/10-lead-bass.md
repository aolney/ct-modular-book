# '80s Lead & ???Bass
<!-- sic 'Stranger Lead'? -->

This chapter explores additional sound design problems using the problem solving approach elaborated in Chapter \@ref(designing-a-kick-drum).
The first problem is to recreate an 80's-style lead from the show [*Stranger Things*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stranger_Things).
The major strategy used to this problem is working backwards, since the goal is to emulate something that already exists.

SAY SOMETHING ABOUT THE SECOND PROBLEM HERE.

## '80s Lead

The music of the show *Stranger Things* [uses vintage synthesizers](https://www.synthhistory.com/post/interview-with-kyle-dixon-michael-stein) in order to match the 1980's setting of the show.
The theme song uses an [arpeggio](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arpeggio) as a lead.
An arpeggio is a type of broken chord, or chord that is played one note at a time.
Arpeggios are a common element in electronic music likely because many synthesizers (and VCOs) have historically been monophonic and so can only play one note at a time.
<!-- The *Stranger Things* theme arpeggio plays up and down over a broken C major 7th chord: low C, E, G, B, C, B, G, E and then repeats throughout the theme. -->
Recreating the *Stranger Things* arpeggio in modular is an interesting sound design problem because it requires working backward from the recording and doing a little detective work to infer how the sound was originally created.

### Waveshape

The first step is to determine the waveshape used in the arpeggio.
Because the theme is composed using vintage synthesizers, we can expect it to use basic waveshapes like sine, triangle, saw, or square rather than a complex wavetable.
Listen to the theme in Figure \@ref(fig:stranger-things-theme) to see if you can identify what kind of waveshape is used, paying particular attention to the brightness of the sound, which indicates higher harmonics.

To me, it starts off a bit dull, like a sine or triangel, then gets brighter around 15 seconds, duller again around 30 seconds, and has a quick run up to brightness around 50 seconds.
The brightness suggests that the waveshape is either saw or square.
We'll return to the change in brightness in a moment.

Saws and square waves can be distinguished by their frequency spectrum as discussed in Section \@ref(resonators-formants-and-frequency-spectrum).
Specifically, saws have both even and odd harmonics, whereas squares have only odd harmonics.
Thus a frequency spectrum could help identify which waveshape is being used.
It is much more convenient to use Audacity for this than R because Audacity allows selections of tracks to be auditioned and then frequency spectrum to be computed for those selections.
This makes it relatively easy to isolate a portion of the song with just a single note of the arpeggio while it is bright.^[To calculate frequency spectrum in Audacity, drag select the region of the audio, audition it using the play button, and then use Analyze -> Plot Spectrum. A high window size is needed for a detailed spectrum, e.g. 4096.]
Figure \@ref(fig:stranger-things-theme-frequency-audacity-7-top-4096) shows the frequency spectrum of a single note of the arpeggio around 50 seconds.

Characteristics of the frequency peaks are shown in Table \@ref(tab:stranger-things-ref-peaks), including the harmonic ratio of each peak with the fundamental.
Assume for a moment that these are harmonics even though the harmonic ratios are not strictly integers.
Since both even and odd harmonics are present, this spectrum is consistent with a saw wave.
However, this pattern could also be observed if there were two square waves, one with a fundamental at 40 Hz and one with a fundamental at 82 Hz.^[Because 80 Hz is the second harmonic of 40 Hz, the harmonics of the 80 Hz square wave would look like the even harmonics of 40 Hz.]

The ambiguity between a single saw and two squares can interrogated by examining the amplitudes in Table \@ref(tab:stranger-things-ref-peaks).
The amplitude peaks at 82 Hz and 164 Hz could be from constructive interference, specifically a saw at 40 Hz and a square at 82 Hz where the square reinforces the existing harmonics of the saw.
Alternatively, these amplitude peaks could potentially be created by two square waves where the square wave at 82 Hz is mixed in more strongly.


Table: (\#tab:stranger-things-ref-peaks) Characterisitcs of the frequency peaks in Figure \@ref(fig:stranger-things-theme-frequency-audacity-7-top-4096).

| Frequency | Amplitude  | Harmonic Ratio |
|-----------|------------|----------------|
| 40        | -39.1      | 1.00           |
| 82        | -25.2      | 2.05           |
| 122       | -39.6      | 3.05           |
| 164       | -27.4      | 4.10           |
| 204       | -40.5      | 5.10           |
| 247       | -43.7      | 6.18           |
| 285       | -43.4      | 7.13           |
| 326       | -37.1      | 8.15           |
| 367       | -46.9      | 9.18           |
| 410       | -40.6      | 10.25          |

These possibilities can be examined by modeling each in modular.
The problem solving approach then is to create a model of each possibility and then use them to reason about how the true frequency spectrum was created.
This is a subtle, yet significant shift in using modular: we are now using it to create alternative models in order to reason about the correct model.
Try patching two square waves at 40 and 82 Hz and a saw and square wave at the same frequencies using the button in Figure \@ref(fig:st-square40-square82).
Because the current spectrum analyzers available in Rack are too noisy to closely compare with the target spectrum, you'll need to [record output with Audacity](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/tutorial_recording_audio_playing_on_the_computer.html) and [plot spectrum there](https://manual.audacityteam.org/man/plot_spectrum.html).^[The Bogaudio spectrum analyzers are sufficient for *approximately* matching spectrum at higher quality settings, but these are not currently working in Cardinal and so must be used in VCVRack. High quality spectrum comparisons currently require Audacity regardless.]

Figure \@ref(fig:stranger-things_two-squares-and-saw-square-mixed-to-match-sample7) shows the frequency spectrum of the two square waves and the saw plus square wave model. 
In both cases, the first three harmonics approximately match the target spectrum in Figure \@ref(fig:stranger-things-theme-frequency-audacity-7-top-4096), but they diverge on the 4th harmonic.
Our inability to get the 4th harmonic with either of these models suggests another element is needed.
One possibility is a third wave, but we may also be able to further adjust the spectrum in our existing models by applying PWM to the square waves. 


Try adjusting the PWM on both of these until the spectrum looks similar to our sample.
