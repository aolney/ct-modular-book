<p>Let’s start with why I’m writing it – that may help justify why you might want to read it.
I got into electronic music in the 90’s when I lived in London but never transitioned from DJing to making music, though several of my friends did.
A few years ago, they started talking about modular, and in talking to them and trying to find out more about it, I realized a few things:</p>
<ul>
<li>The best books (to me) were from the 70’s and 80’s<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;Old books that I like are &lt;span class="citation"&gt;David Crombie, &lt;em&gt;The &lt;span&gt;Complete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Synthesizer&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;A&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Comprehensive&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Guide&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Omnipress Books, 1982)&lt;/span&gt; and &lt;span class="citation"&gt;Allen Strange, &lt;em&gt;Electronic &lt;span&gt;Music&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;Systems&lt;/span&gt;, &lt;span&gt;Techniques&lt;/span&gt;, and &lt;span&gt;Controls&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt;, 2nd ed. (Dubuque, Iowa: William C Brown Publishers, 1983)&lt;/span&gt;. Newer books of note are &lt;span class="citation"&gt;Kim Bjørn and Chris Meyer, &lt;em&gt;Patch &amp;amp; &lt;span&gt;Tweak&lt;/span&gt;: &lt;span&gt;Exploring&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Modular&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Synthesis&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Bjooks, 2018)&lt;/span&gt;, which gives a great overview of module hardware and history, &lt;span class="citation"&gt;Ziv Eliraz, &lt;span&gt;“Loopop’s &lt;span&gt;In&lt;/span&gt;-&lt;span&gt;Complete&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Book&lt;/span&gt; of &lt;span&gt;Electronic&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Music&lt;/span&gt;,”&lt;/span&gt; accessed August 20, 2022, &lt;a href="https://www.patreon.com/loopop" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://www.patreon.com/loopop&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/span&gt;, which gives a broader overview of issues related to musical equipment and production, and &lt;span class="citation"&gt;Tupla Dusha, Anna Martonova, and Pete Johnston, &lt;em&gt;Modular &lt;span&gt;Sound&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;Synthesis&lt;/span&gt; &lt;span&gt;On&lt;/span&gt; the &lt;span&gt;Moon&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/em&gt; (Modular Moon, 2020)&lt;/span&gt;, which gives a modern but briefer introduction to modular than the older books. There are also some online courses (paid), but since I haven’t taken them, I’m not listing them here.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>1</sup></a>
</li>
<li>Modular synthesis is really well aligned with <em>computational thinking</em>
</li>
</ul>
<p>If you’ve never heard of computational thinking and don’t know much about modular, that last point won’t make a lot of sense, so let’s break it down.</p>
<p>Modular sound synthesis (modular) creates sound by connecting modules that each perform some function on sound.
Different sounds are created by combining modules in different ways.</p>
<p>Computational thinking creates runnable models to solve a problem or answer a question.
Models can be simulation models (e.g. meteorology), data models (e.g. statistics/data science), computation models (computer science), and perhaps other kinds of models.</p>
<p>How are they connected? Modular involves computational thinking when we:</p>
<ul>
<li>Simulate an instrument by reverse engineering its sound</li>
<li>Create new sounds based on models of signal processing</li>
</ul>
<p>So this book is about modular, but it approaches modular in a way that highlights computational thinking.
I believe this deeper approach to modular will help you do more with it and also help you with other synthesizers or studio production tools.
The computational thinking approach should help accelerate your learning of computational-thinking domains in the future.</p>
<p>Since computational thinking involves problem solving, this book is full of interactive activities that will let you hone your modular skills.</p>

<p><span class="citation">Matti Tedre and Peter J. Denning<a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content='&lt;p&gt;&lt;span&gt;“The Long Quest for Computational Thinking,”&lt;/span&gt; in &lt;em&gt;Proceedings of the 16th Koli Calling International Conference on Computing Education Research&lt;/em&gt;, Koli Calling ’16 (New York, NY, USA: Association for Computing Machinery, 2016), 120–29, &lt;a href="https://doi.org/10.1145/2999541.2999542" role="doc-biblioref"&gt;https://doi.org/10.1145/2999541.2999542&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;'><sup>2</sup></a></span> present a nice overview of the history of computational thinking.
Here’s a brief summary.</p>
<p>When the field of computing was taking off in the 1950s, there was interest and discussion about how it was different from other fields (e.g. math).
One argument was that computing involved <em>algorithmic thinking</em>, which is designing algorithms to solve problems (cf. programming).
Some even thought that this kind of thinking could improve thinking generally.</p>
<p><em>Computational thinking</em> appears to have been coined in the 1980’s by Seymour Papert and popularized in his book <em>Mindstorms</em><span class="citation"><a class="footnote-ref" tabindex="0" data-toggle="popover" data-content="&lt;p&gt;Seymour Papert, &lt;em&gt;Mindstorms: Children, Computers, and Powerful Ideas&lt;/em&gt; (New York: Basic Books, 1980).&lt;/p&gt;"><sup>3</sup></a></span>.
Papert was a mathematician by training, but his approach was much broader than the algorithmic thinking folks that came before.
Instead, his approach was empirical and embraced model building, with an emphasis on simulated microworlds containing robots (LEGO Mindstorms takes its name from this work).</p>
<p>Unfortunately today it’s very hard to get agreement on what computational thinking is, so definitions tend to be squishy.
Some want to reduce it to computer literacy, others to basic programming, and yet others to discovery learning with computers.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>STOPPED HERE</p>
</blockquote>
<p>My take</p>
<p>Computational thinking means building runnable models to solve a problem</p>
<p>For an algorithmic problem, this is a model of computation (the original CS view)</p>
<p>For data science/statistics, this is a model of data</p>
<p>For general scientific fields, this is a model of a phenomenon or process</p>
<p>How do we learn to build runnable models to solve problems?</p>
<p>Models are made of interacting elements, so
We need to learn the elements
We need to learn how they interact</p>
<p>General problem solving has the same basic steps (Pólya, 1945)
Understand the problem
Make a plan
Implement the plan
Evaluate the solution</p>
<p>For any new domain, the big things to learn are the elements, how they interact, and the “make a plan” step of problem solving</p>

</h2>
<p>Early on
Mechanical (so not synthesizers, which are electric by definition)
Barrel organs, player pianos, speech synthesis using bellows
Shows interest in automating parts of sound production or producing sound using models
Electrical (simple or massive)
Elisha Gray (1874) – simple oscillators, two octaves, over telegraph
Thaddeus Cahill (1879) – 153 keys, polyphonic, and could sound like an organ or various wood instruments but weighed 210 tons!
1960s-
Modular synthesizers developed (Moog, Buchla, Tcherepnin); modules combined with patch cables to make sounds; a Moog modular then in today’s cost is about $96K.
1970s –
Semi-modular synthesizers developed; can be patched like modular but are invisibly pre-patched, which patching overrides; a Minimoog then in today’s cost is about $10K.</p>
<p>1980s –
Digital makes low-cost devices powerful; a Yamaha DX7 then in today’s cost is about $6K.
1990s –
Computers become powerful enough that making/recording music is possible, reducing costs further; a Gateway computer with Cubase then in today’s cost is about $8K.
2010s –
Modular synthesizers resurge with lower costs connected to widespread electronics manufacturing, smartphones, and the open-source movement; an ALM System Coupe modular system costs $2.4K and VCVRack (virtual modular) is free.</p>
<p>Reducing cost for wider adoption</p>
<p>Simplifying use for wider adoption
Semi-modular
Special purpose modules vs. general purpose modules</p>
<p>Diversification of uses
A complete composition
A single voice
An effects box</p>
