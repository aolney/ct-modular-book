asymmetry grew increasing modulation index, EFM’s pitch shifts upward harmonic ratios destroyed.\nEFM, problems intrinsic EFM moves output equal musical intervals rather equal frequencies.\nEven though LFM doesn’t intrinsically asymmetry problem, asymmetry problem practical use.understand asymmetry problem LFM, consider simple example.\nSuppose 100 Hz modulator 400 Hz carrier .\nincrease

Hz.\n\nanalogue oscillators implement LFM don’t go zero rather stop zero, FM becomes asymmetric point ranges frequencies carrier , leading pitch shift.\npitch shift pulls sidebands away zero, destroys harmonic ratios just like EFM.Perhaps best way contrast EFM LFM EFM, intrinsic problems, whereas LFM, problems arise relatively higher modulation index.\npractice, however, typically want higher
